Implementation of Compressed Sensing-Based Distributed Image Compression

This uses the technique described in 'Compressed Sensing-Based Distributed Image Compression' Muhammad Yousuf Baig 1, Edmund M-K Lai 2,* and Amal Punchihewa 3.

Uses:
- OpenCV for matrix and image operations
- Boost library for serialisation

Possible improvements
- Multithreading in decoder: Although I tried this to an extent and it slowed things down
- Use of a faster matrix library
